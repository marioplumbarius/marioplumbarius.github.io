Before becoming a Software Engineer, I had a few jobs that helped me grow and expand my horizons.

## Street Vendor

> Income: $20-$100 per week.  
> Working Days: 2 per week.  
> Age: 7-10 years old.

![Mario Street Vendor](mario-street-vendor.png#center)

My aunt was a full-time street vendor in S達o Paulo. She sold all random things you can imagine, from small batteries up to clothes. During my childhood, I spent a lot of time with her, and in multiple ocasions, I would go to free market and sell those items. I also sold biscuits in buses during S達o Paulo rush hours, with a friend from the church - in 2 occasions. My mom would also cook some home-made ice cream, which I'd sell around our neighborhood.

Being a stree vendor requires a lot of **social skills** and **resilience**, because you have to convince people to spend their money on products they were not planning to buy. This gets even worse if you have to sell low-quality products, such as the ones me and my aunt sold. If you had a bad sleep the night before, you need to learn how to put a smile on your face and pretend to be the happiest person on earth; otherwise, you won't be able to provide for your family.

### Social Skills

![Mario Social Skills](mario-social-skills.png#center)

My aunt was better than Steve Jobs when the topic was elevator pitch: she mastered how to make connections with people and this was more than enough to ensure she would live a life without a boss for more than two decades by selling products in the streets of S達o Paulo. She was loved by literally anyone the moment she entered the room. She was so good at socializing that people would buy her products just because they wanted to have a good conversation with her.

I, at the other hand, was a very quiet and observing child.
> Why would I try to sell a product for someone that didn't ask for it?  
> Why would I smile to someone that I don't even know?  
> Why do I have to be nice to someone that is not even nice to me?

As a very shy kid, my brain was full of those thoughts and I simply couldn't become a social butterfly overnight. However, I could see the impact my aunt's social skills had in our lives, I knew I had to try to be more social. The only mistake here was that I didn't know I would need constant support - which I never really had for various reasons, including the fact my whole family was trying to survive without formal education and social inequalities. Supporting me in my journey to become more social was the least of their concerns.

#### Lessons Learned
It took me more than 20 years to figure out how to become more social. Once I learned, I decided I don't want to. I learned being my best self, shy, is more important then being social. In fact, I learned the more I respect my uniqueness, the more happy I become.

### Resilience

![Mario Fake Money](mario-fake-money.png#center)

You also have to deal with scams: people giving you fake money or trying to steal your products. I was 7 years old when a lady approached me and asked for a product, which costs 5 usd. She game me a 20 usd, which I had excahnge in a nearby shop. When I arrived, folks realized it was fake and then I got back as fast as I could - maybe she didn't know it was fake, right?! Both the product and her soul were gone by the time I returned.

#### Five Whys

**1. Why I didn't check if the note was fake before leaving the shop?**  
Because I was too excited to sell the product and didn't think she could try to scam me.

**2. Why I didn't think she could try to scam me?**  
Because I thought people would only do bad things to you as a response to bad things you do to them. Since I was being nice to her, I thought she would be nice to me in return.

**3. Why did she gave me a fake note?**  
Because she was a scammer. She decided to take advantage of a 7 years old kid to get a product for free.

**4. Why was she a scammer?**  
There are 99 reasons for people to become scammers, such as the result of the historical trajectory (social and economic disparities) set by [Pedro Alvares Cabral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral#Discovery_of_Brazil) more than 500 years ago.

**5. Why colonization of Brazil contributed to scamming?**  
- Short answer: Because social imbalances - left behind by [Colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism) - push individuals toward unethical behaviors as a means to cope and survive.
- Long answer: Nowadays, as a Software Engineer, part of my job is to influence people different than me to do things I find relavant to the business - including when they don't agree with me. If I establish and maintain control and exploitation of those individuals, what do you think the result would be?

#### Lessons Learned
Never leave the shop unattended.  Never trust people who are not from my family. Always check if money is fake or not.

## Flyer Distribution

> Income: $50 per day.  
> Working Days: 2 per week.  
> Age: 12-14 years old.

![Mario Flyer Distribution](mario-flyer-distribution.png#center)

### Plaza Sul Shopping
Distribution of flyers in the streets and traffic of S達o Paulo is a common practice for young folks in Brazil. My first job as a flyer distributor was for a company that restored car's seats. Every weekend, I'd distribute two hundred flyers to cars stopped by a [traffic light in front of Plaza Sul Shopping](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HL5Z9Zfbo2bWpEmMA). Given how shy I was back then, and how hot the sun was close to lunch time, it was quite challenging.

### Uncle's Pizzeria
My uncle opened a Pizzeria, and the best way to let customers know there is a new player in the neighborhood was to distribute flyers. Every weekend, he would drop me with give hundred flyers and I'd distrubute them in the streets nearby. It was an overly repetitive job - one flyer at a time being thrown inside a house - there were five hundred of them, so it would always take me hours before I could finish distributing. My feet hurt really bad and I couldn't think about anything else other than:
> How many flyers do I have left? Am I close to the end?  
> What do I have to do, so that I never have to do this again?

Well, at the age of 11-14 (yeah, my memory sucks), I didn't have many options, so I chose the best option I had at that time: I threw some of them in the bin. lol. Sorry, uncle, I was learning, it was a necessary experience to understand my own limits.

## Printing Service

> Income: pizza and minimum wage.  
> Working Days: 5 days peer week.  
> Age: 12-15 years old.

![Mario Printing Services](mario-printing-services.png#center)

My uncle also owned a printing service, which I would ocassionally help him with. At the end of the shift, we would eat a good Brazilian Pizza. Good deal, right?

Sometime between 12 and 15 years old, I asked him to work full-time. It was the first time I was paid more than a hundred dollars per month; it was also the first time I had to work on a schedule, from Monday to Friday. Being able to pay for my own expenses was a big deal for me, but I don't remember how I spent the money other than with fast food. Lots of it.

It was a family business. That's where I met my cousin-in-law, Vagner. Vagner was older than me. He had a car and goals in life. I was just a teenager trying to figure out how to survive. Vagner also liked to party. A lot!

### Taking risks: a nap on the bathroom

![Mario Bathroom](mario-bathroom.png#center)

One day, me and Vagner went to a party, on a Sunday evening. We had a good time. So good we didn't even sleep and went to work the next day. I could barely stand still, but I tried my best. I was so tired that I slept on the bathroom. 2 hours later, I left the bathroom after the crowd at work was wondering if I was dead or alive. My uncle was furious, but he didn't fire me.

The excitement lasted for a few months, because the work was manual and brutally repetitive - I'd literally repeat the same task over and over again, for 8 hours a day. Piles of paper to fold. It was a torture.

A few months later, I got fired. Thanks uncle!

#### Lessons Learned
Family-owned business has a lower entry barrier. Party should always come after work, not before. Repetitive tasks are highly detrimental to my level of satisfaction.

## LAN center

> Income: $400 per month.  
> Working Days: 5 per week.  
> Age: 16 years old.

![Mario Computer Attendant](mario-computer-attendant.png#center)

Back in 2006, Brazil was giving free bus rides to elderly people, in an attempt to provide them with a better quality of life. Many of them wanted to travel cross-state, so they would head over to [one of the busiest bus terminals in Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiet%C3%AA_Bus_Terminal). There was a LAN center in that bus terminal that offered printing services - that's where elderly people would go to print their bus tickets.

### My first interview

![Mario Interview](mario-interview.png#center)

One of the bus drivers told my mom the LAN center was hiring, so I applied. I don't remember much from that interview, but I do recall me and the manager had a coffee together and chatted about the role. I was a bit confused why he was so cool with me, but later I realized paying less than the minimum wage for a teenager to work in a highly stressful environment was a good deal, for him. Regardless, it was one of the best interviews I've ever had. Thanks for the chat, Mr. Manager!

So, I got the job: 20 hours per week, 4 hours per day, 5 days a week. I was paid $400 per month. So far so good, except, I had to open the LAN center at 6am sharp. If the LAN center didn't open on time, it would get fined. To this day, I still don't know how much the fine was, but given how broken Brazilian culture is, I'm pretty sure it was a lot. Thanks Mr. Manager for never telling me how much it was, because...

### Social Skills
The job consisted of opening and operating the LAN center, talking to customers (a lot of them) and printing bus tickets to elderly people. Operating the computers was easy, but dealing with customers was brutally stressful. Because it was a bus terminal, I would easily speak to 50-100 people per day. At the end of my shift, I was exausted. Many people didn't even know how to use a computer, and they would get angry if they couldn't achieve what they wanted, the way they wanted it.

At the flip side, because I spoke English, many foreigners would come to me to ask for help. One day, a visitor from the US stopped by to ask for help and stayed for several hours talking about life and how life in US is so much easier than in Brazil. It was the first time I spoke with a foreigner in English, and I sounded like [Lil Wayne](http://lilwayne-brasil.blogspot.com/) after the first 40 minutes - so good.

#### Lessons Learned
Dealing with customers was challenging and required a lot of patience. Conversation is one of the best ways to practice a new language (English).

### Taking risks: sleeping at my desk

![Mario Sleeping Desk](mario-sleeping-desk.png#center)

Considering my history of going to work after party, 6am was way too early for a young teenager making $400 per month and learning how to have fun. History repeated itself: I went to a party on Sunday evening, didn't sleep and went straight to work. I was so tired that I slept on my desk multiple times. Customers would literally poke me to wake me up, multiple times. I don't remember exactly what happened that day, but I didn't get fired.

#### Lessons Learned
I must never party on Sunday evening. I'm not a morning person.

## Delivery (by bus)

> Income: minimum wage.  
> Working Days: 5 per week.  
> Age: 17 years old.

I worked as the delivery guy for a dental prostheses, which was a family-owned business from one of my friends. My job was to deliver the prostheses to the dentist's office by public transport. I liked to travel by bus, so it was a good deal. I'd deliver from 2 to 4 dental prostheses per day and travel 100km max. Buses in Brazil were very noisy and crowded, so this was a way to practice my resilience.

### Lessons Learned
Repetitive tasks are highly detrimental to my level of satisfaction, even if they are a little bit dynamic, such as traveling around the city by bus.

## Logistics
