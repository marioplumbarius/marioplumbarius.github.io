## Street Vendor

![Mario Street Vendor](mario-street-vendor.png#center)

My aunt was a full-time street vendor in São Paulo. She sold all random things you can imagine, from small batteries up to clothes. During my childhood, I spent a lot of time with her, and in multiple ocasions, I would go to free market and sell those items. I also sold biscuits in buses during São Paulo rush hours, with a friend from the church - in 2 occasions. My mom would also cook some home-made ice cream, which I'd sell in the streets.

Being a stree vendor requires a lot of social skills and resilience, because you have to convince people to spend their money on products they were not planning to buy. This gets even worse if you have to sell low-quality products, such as the ones me and my aunt sold. If you had a bad sleep the night before, you need to learn how to put a smile on your face and pretend to be the happiest person on earth.

You also have to deal with scams, people giving you fake money or trying to steal your products. A lady once approached me and asked for a product. She game me a R$20 note, which I had to go somewhere else to exchange. By the time I got back, she was gone. The note was fake. I was 7 years old back then. Humans are wild animals.
