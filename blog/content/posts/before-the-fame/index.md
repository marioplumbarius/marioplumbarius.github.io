Before becoming a Software Engineer, I had a few jobs that helped me grow and expand my horizons.

## Street Vendor

> Income: $20-$100 per week.  
> Age: 7-10 years old.

![Mario Street Vendor](mario-street-vendor.png#center)

My aunt was a full-time street vendor in S達o Paulo. She sold all random things you can imagine, from small batteries up to clothes. During my childhood, I spent a lot of time with her, and in multiple ocasions, I would go to free market and sell those items. I also sold biscuits in buses during S達o Paulo rush hours, with a friend from the church - in 2 occasions. My mom would also cook some home-made ice cream, which I'd sell around our neighborhood.

Being a stree vendor requires a lot of **social skills** and **resilience**, because you have to convince people to spend their money on products they were not planning to buy. This gets even worse if you have to sell low-quality products, such as the ones me and my aunt sold. If you had a bad sleep the night before, you need to learn how to put a smile on your face and pretend to be the happiest person on earth; otherwise, you won't be able to provide for your family.

### Social Skills

![Mario Social Skills](mario-social-skills.png#center)

My aunt was better than Steve Jobs when the topic was elevator pitch: she mastered how to make connections with people and this was more than enough to ensure she would live a life without a boss for more than two decades by selling products in the streets of S達o Paulo. She was loved by literally anyone the moment she entered the room. She was so good at socializing that people would buy her products just because they wanted to have a good conversation with her.

I, at the other hand, was a very quiet and observing child.
> Why would I try to sell a product for someone that didn't ask for it?  
> Why would I smile to someone that I don't even know?  
> Why do I have to be nice to someone that is not even nice to me?

As a very shy kid, my brain was full of those thoughts and I simply couldn't become a social butterfly overnight. However, I could see the impact my aunt's social skills had in our lives, I knew I had to try to be more social. The only mistake here was that I didn't know I would need constant support - which I never really had for various reasons, including the fact my whole family was trying to survive without formal education and social inequalities. Supporting me in my journey to become more social was the least of their concerns.

#### Lesson Learned
It took me more than 20 years to figure out how to become more social. Once I learned, I decided I don't want to. I learned being my best self, shy, is more important then being social. In fact, I learned the more I respect my uniqueness, the more happy I become.

### Resilience

![Mario Fake Money](mario-fake-money.png#center)

You also have to deal with scams: people giving you fake money or trying to steal your products. I was 7 years old when a lady approached me and asked for a product, which costs 5 usd. She game me a 20 usd, which I had excahnge in a nearby shop. When I arrived, folks realized it was fake and then I got back as fast as I could - maybe she didn't know it was fake, right?! Both the product and her soul were gone by the time I returned.

#### Five Whys

**1. Why I didn't check if the note was fake before leaving the shop?**  
Because I was too excited to sell the product and didn't think she could try to scam me.

**2. Why I didn't think she could try to scam me?**  
Because I thought people would only do bad things to you as a response to bad things you do to them. Since I was being nice to her, I thought she would be nice to me in return.

**3. Why did she gave me a fake note?**  
Because she was a scammer. She decided to take advantage of a 7 years old kid to get a product for free.

**4. Why was she a scammer?**  
There are 99 reasons for people to become scammers, such as the result of the historical trajectory (social and economic disparities) set by [Pedro Alvares Cabral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral#Discovery_of_Brazil) more than 500 years ago.

**5. Why colonization of Brazil contributed to scamming?**  
- Short answer: Because social imbalances - left behind by [Colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism) - push individuals toward unethical behaviors as a means to cope and survive.
- Long answer: Nowadays, as a Software Engineer, part of my job is to influence people different than me to do things I find relavant to the business - including when they don't agree with me. If I establish and maintain control and exploitation of those individuals, what do you think the result would be?

#### Lesson Learned
Never leave the shop unattended.  Never trust people who are not from my family. Always check if money is fake or not.

## Flyer Distribution

> Income: $50 per day.  
> Age: 12-14 years old.

### Plaza Sul Shopping

Distribution of flyers in the streets and traffic of S達o Paulo is a common practice for young folks in Brazil. My first job as a flyer distributor was for a company that restored car's seats. Every weekend, I'd distribute two hundred flyers to cars stopped by a traffic light in Plaza Sul Shopping (see below). Given how shy I was back then, and how hot the sun was close to lunch time, it was quite challenging.

### Uncle's Pizzeria
My uncle opened a Pizzeria, and the best way to let customers know there is a new player in the neighborhood was to distribute flyers. Every weekend, he would drop me with give hundred flyers and I'd distrubute them in the streets nearby. It was an overly repetitive job - one flyer at a time being thrown inside a house - there were five hundred of them, so it would always take me hours before I could finish distributing. My feet hurt really bad and I couldn't think about anything else other than:
> How many flyers do I have left? Am I close to the end?  
> What do I have to do, so that I never have to do this again?

Well, at 12 years old, I didn't have many options, so I chose the best option I had at that time: I threw them in the bin. lol. Sorry, uncle, I was learning, it was a necessary experience to understand my own limits.
