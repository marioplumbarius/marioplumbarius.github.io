### 1990: My first video game appearance (Donkey Kong)
I was born in a city named [Caicó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caic%C3%B3), from state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The name Caicó is derived from the indigenous word Queicuó, meaning 'Cuó river and mountain'.

### 1992: The debut appearance of Wario (Super Mario Land 2)
In the early 1990s, Brazil faced significant economic challenges, including high inflation, unemployment, and limited economic opportunities in rural and less developed areas - Caicó being one of them. São Paulo - being the industrial and financial center - attracted many people from across Brazil seeking better living conditions and economic prospects. In 1992, my family (Mama, aunts and uncles) moved to São Paulo looking for better opportunities.
