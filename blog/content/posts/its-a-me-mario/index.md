I was born in [Caicó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caic%C3%B3), a city in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The name Caicó is originates from the [indigenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Brazil) word *'Queicuó'*, which means *'Cuó river and mountain'*. The region is also known for constant **droughts and extreme poverty**.

### 1992: The debut appearance of Wario (Super Mario Land 2)

In the early 1990s, Brazil faced [significant economic challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Brazil#1990%E2%80%931993) in less developed areas, such as Caicó. [São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo) - being the industrial and financial center - attracted my Mama's family, which were seeking better living conditions and economic prospects. We moved in 1992.
