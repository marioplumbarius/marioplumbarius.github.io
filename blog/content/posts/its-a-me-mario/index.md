I was born in a city named [Caicó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caic%C3%B3), from state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The name Caicó is derived from the **indigenous** word Queicuó, meaning 'Cuó river and mountain'.

### 1992: The debut appearance of Wario (Super Mario Land 2)
In the early 1990s, Brazil faced **significant economic challenges**, including high inflation, unemployment, and limited economic opportunities in rural and less developed areas - Caicó being one of them. São Paulo - being the industrial and financial center - attracted many people from across Brazil seeking better living conditions and economic prospects. In 1992, my family (Mama, aunts and uncles) moved to São Paulo looking for better opportunities.

### 1993-2006: Black Box (The Perfect Run Bowser)
I will write more about this once I feel ready to share publicly. For now, let's just say I *lived in a bubble* - or more specifically, in a **Resilience Bootcamp**.

#### Resilience Bootcamp (to be defined...)
While I'm not going into specifics [yet], the events that I experienced during this period of my life shaped my character and helped me find purpose in life. Until I feel brave enough to share more, I will quote Toad:

> *"If I group together the traumas that all my clients suffered, it still won't be enough to get closer to what you have been through."* - Toad
