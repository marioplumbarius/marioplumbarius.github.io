## 1990: Hello, World!

![Caico](caico.jpg#center)

I was born in [Caicó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caic%C3%B3), a city in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The name Caicó originates from the [indigenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Brazil) word *'Queicuó'*, which means *'Cuó river and mountain'*. The region is also known for constant **droughts and extreme poverty**.

In the early 1990s, Brazil faced [significant economic challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Brazil#1990%E2%80%931993) in less developed areas, such as Caicó. [São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo) - being the industrial and financial center - attracted my Mama's family, which were seeking better living conditions and economic prospects. We moved to São Paulo in 1992.

## 2011: How I discovered Computer Science
Back in 2011, I was working as a [SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide) consultant at [Red Bricks Media](https://www.linkedin.com/company/red-bricks-media/) and getting really good at it... so good I started looking at what others were doing around the company, so that I could make my work more efficient.

That's when I met [Diogo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diogotozzi/) - a Software Engineer so passionate about Computer Science, that he would easily spend all his lunch break answering my newbie questions about how computer works, **create a course to teach me programming with PHP** and become a close friend. I was so blown away by what Diogo told me about computers back then, that I couldn't stop thinking about what I would be able to do, if I became a Computer Scientist like himself. So I dove deep into the topic and started learning about how to build websites.

## 2012: University (first trial)
After a year or so studying [how to think like a Computer Scientist](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/) ~~on my employers computers~~, I decided it was the career I wanted to pursue. So I enrolled into [Computer Science at Universidade Anhembi Morumbi](https://portal.anhembi.br/graduacao/ciencia-da-computacao/).

### My first computer
Investing in a computer as a 22 year old me was... challenging. I was married, living in a 1-bedroom house with my in-law and 3 dogs. I didn’t have the money to buy it, so I took out a loan from a financial institution and hoped I'd be able to pay it fully. Turns out I never did, but it was the best investment I did back then. It allowed me to have access to free education, other cultures and, more importantly, it **empowered me to be my best self**.

It was a Samsung Laptop running ~~Windows~~ **Linux** (thanks to [Erik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikhenrique/) for the *influence*) - which was the perfect fit for me, given I was hungry to learn everything about computers.

### Finding an internship

![Mario Internship](mario-internship.png#center)

#### 1st Attempt: Failed
Back then, I didn't know how to build connections with people, so I always used a direct approach. First I asked the course coordinator for instructions on how to find an internship.
> Hey Mario. You're here only for 4 months. It's your first semester. You need to wait at least until your 4th semester to apply for internships. You won't find anything until then. Have patience.

#### 2nd Attempt: Skipped
After that terrible conversation, I pulled a list of ALL tech startups in São Paulo and sent an email to them introducing myself and asking for an internship. In return, they would have a chance to pay me less than what the market pays, because I'd be forever grateful for the opportunity and work really hard.

A lot of them replied. Some of them didn't have an open role, but they still wanted to let me know my behavior was awesome. I did get into few interviews, but declined, because they were not aligned with my values and goals.

#### 3rd Attempt: Succeeded!
I said I didn't know how to build connections with everyone, but I knew how to make them laugh, and I made [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfilho/) laugh hard many times. So I asked him to recommend me to [iG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/portalig/) for an internship. Which he did. I and other two class mates from uni passed the interview and we worked as a team. Let's go!

## 2013: Internship
![](https://ig-canais-noticias.pages.dev/logo_iguinho_home.webp#center)
I left my stable paying SEO job to work as an intern in a field I wasn't familiar with yet. The moment I did that, I started to use my savings to pay for my uni. In fact, I wouldn't have cashflow to pay for my bills in 6 months. Interestingly enough, that was the timeline for my internship, so I worked really hard to get promoted to a full-time role. And thanks to the shockingly empowerment I received from everyone at iG, I not only got a full-time role, but I also transitioned to a Backend role (something I learned I prefered) and then got a huge pay bump.

My time at iG was one of the most enjoyable experiences at work I've ever had. I will talk more about this in the future, but for now, I'll just say that it was life changing.
